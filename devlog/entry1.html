	<p>In my last journal, "GoldSRC + Godot = ???", I wrote about the 
	idea of a game engine/framework built on top of Godot, that aims 
	to have a workflow very similar to GoldSRC. You can map for it 
	with J.A.C.K., TrenchBroom, or even Hammer in theory, AND sell 
	games made with it. Then I stopped working on that and moved 
	back to my ioquake3 fork, BurekTech. Same idea, different engine.

	WE SQUASHED THEM BUGS
	</p>

	<p>
	3 big issues were closed this month, pushing the completion from 11% to 29%. 
	I ported a good chunk of the game code from C/idTech 3 way to C++/BurekTech way.
	</p>

	<p>
	What this means is, instead of a bunch of global functions and structs, 
	I now have some classes responsible for the game logic (entity spawning, 
	for example), as well as some entity classes. So I didn't just rename all 
	.c files to .cpp and fix the compile errors.
	</p>

	<p class="imgcont">

	Looks like a ghost town when no entities are 'round
	</p>

	<p>
	After all the remaining required functionality is ported (spawning temp 
	entities, selecting a spawnpoint (the player spawns at 0,0,0 at the moment), 
	making sure MP works), the next step is to re-implement some important <code>trigger_</code>, 
	<code>func_</code> and <code>info_</code> entities. Then write some utilities, like for gib spawning; a 
	basic AI for NPCs (the Q3 bot code is big, no way I'm porting that soon D:); 
	and, maybe not immediately, a save-load system.
	<br>
	Another concept I had was entity semi-components, but certainly won't be in version 0.1.
	</p>

	<p>
	BurekTech is not really an engine IMO, since most of the work is done in the game 
	library. It's not an engine-agnostic game framework either. It's like... a game base? 
	I dunno.<br>
	With that said, BurekTech 2.0 should be initially based on a different engine like 
	Godot (partially due to licencing), most likely as a plugin. The idea is still gonna 
	be the same. The folder structure is still gonna be (largely) the same. You get the point.
	</p>

	<p>
	Anyway, I hope that BurekTech will be ready enough by the end of December, so I can 
	start making a game in January. Or in February. It's gonna be a medium-paced retro FPS, 
	set in 2033 Bosnia. I might post a few screenshots in the WiP screenshots thread.

		In fact, I believe this could be done within a HL mod. But, I won't experiment 
		with that until 2022.

		When you say that JACK, TB and Hammer can be used, you mean that we can use the 
		standard GoldSRC configuration to map for it? Because JACK supports Quake 3 
		mapping which has some differences like the way you can manipulate the UV map 
		to round a texture on a curved plane, something that the GoldSRC configuration 
		doesn't have (unless it can be added/hacked in it).<br><br>
		By the way, great job my friend!

		@Alberto<br>
		Yes. My main support is for TrenchBroom (Quake 3 map format, w/o patches for now) 
		and J.A.C.K. (true Quake 3 map format). I am assuming that TB will eventually get 
		true Q3 format support, with patches. Patches are actually those curved planes you're 
		alking about. They can also be cylinders, cones, terrain etc., basically meshes inside 
		the BSP like Source displacements.
		<br><br>
		Hammer 3.x is less likely, BUT, as long as you have a q3map2 that supports the Valve 
		220 format (J.A.C.K.'s q3map2 does), you'll be fine. It's of lower priority TBH.<br>
		However, a big issue with Hammer is the textures. Since using GoldSRC-specific 
		formats (MDL, WAD3, HL BSP etc.) is technically illegal in engines outside of 
		GoldSRC, and I wanna make paid games with this engine (and put 'em on Steam at 
		some point), yeah. No. We can forget about Hammer support here.
		<br><br>
		Anyway, another update: now brush entities are solid and can be collided with. 
		I am almost ready to begin re-implementing some of the most needed entities.
